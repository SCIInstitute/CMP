Computational Molecular Phenotyping (CMP) is a micromolecular
profiling technology. Micromolecules can be quantitatively probed with
hapten-specific IgG reagents with subcellular resolution. CMP is the
fusion of three technology platforms: Anti-hapten IgG libraries,
tissue array fabrication, and computational pattern recognition. CMP
profiles multiple metabolites in every cell, concurrently discovers
and phenotypes cell classes, tracks cell state, and maps disease
sequelae in any tissue or organism.

This codebase implements an interface to clustering and visualizing
cell classes from CMP image data. It was created for the Marc/Jones
Lab by Josh Cates (SCI Institute) as part of a project with the TVC
Software Development Center.
