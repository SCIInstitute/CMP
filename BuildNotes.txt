Notes for building qwt on MacOSX (SnowLeopard) using qwt-6.0.0-rc1.  

1) Download standard qwt distribution.

2) Configure qwt: 

* It is easiest to build the static library for distributing applications and
Qt Designer plugins.  Edit qwtconfig.pri and comment out the line enabling
dynamic library builds.

* In some distributions, qwt is configured to build only debug libraries on
Macs.  Edit the qwtbuild.pri file for CONFIG += release

* In some distributions when building the designer plugin and the examples, the
default configuration will look for a qwt framework and will fail when Qt
proper has been installed as a framework.  Edit the designer/designer.pro file
and the examples/examples.pri files as follows: Comment out the
qtAddLibrary(qwt) line.  Add -lqwt to the "LIBS +=" line.

Note 11/2 jc -- In newer distributions (6.0) it looks like they tried to fix
this logic, but it does not work for me.  Looks like they are trying to build
qwt as a framework if qt has been built as a framework, but it doesn't work
correctly when building with gcc. Maybe it works using xcode?  Anyway, needs
revisiting once 6.0.0 stabilizes.


3) Build qwt:
qmake -spec macx-g++
make
sudo make install

4) Copy the libqwt_designer_plugin.dylib file to the /designer/plugins director
for the main Qt install.
