Plots to implement:

* 1D histogram signatures  --  QwtPlot
* 1D image histograms masked by class -- QwtPlot
2D image histograms -- use QwtSpectrogram; see spectrogram example (pans, zooms, etc)
2D image histograms masked by class -- same as above

2D scatterplots -- QwtPlot;  need a random sampling from image function
2D scatterplots -- masked; need another random sampling function under mask
